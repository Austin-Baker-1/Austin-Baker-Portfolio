# 🧠 Data Science Portfolio

As part of my journey from data analyst to data scientist, this portfolio demonstrates my growing expertise in core data science techniques. Each project reflects real-world problem-solving using machine learning, Bayesian inference, natural language processing, and computer vision—built from scratch or using industry-standard tools like scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch.

## 🔍 Areas of Focus
- Classical and deep learning models
- Bayesian A/B testing and adaptive algorithms
- Natural language processing (NLP)
- Computer vision (image classification, object detection)
- Data visualization and storytelling
