# 🧠 Data Science Portfolio

A curated collection of data science projects demonstrating my transition from data analyst to data scientist. The portfolio includes work on machine learning, Bayesian A/B testing, natural language processing, and forecasting. Each project emphasizes practical application, mathematical understanding, and clean, reproducible code using Python and tools like scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch.

## 🔍 Key Areas
- Supervised and unsupervised learning
- Bayesian methods and adaptive experiments
- Deep learning and transformer models
- NLP: topic modeling, sentiment analysis
- Time series analysis and forecasting
